0,Abdominal aortic aneurysm,"In most cases, an AAA causes no noticeable symptoms. However, if it becomes large, some people may develop a pain or a pulsating feeling in their abdomen (tummy) or persistent back pain.
An AAA doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to health, but there’s a risk that a larger aneurysm could burst (rupture).
A ruptured aneurysm can cause massive internal bleeding, which is usually fatal. Around 8 out of 10 people with a rupture either die before they reach hospital or don’t survive surgery.
The most common symptom of a ruptured aortic aneurysm is sudden and severe pain in the abdomen.
If you suspect that you or someone else has had a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.

1,Achilles tendinopathy,"Symptoms may vary from person to person. They can appear gradually or suddenly.
People may experience:

swelling
pain that’s worse during or after moving or exercising
stiffness that’s worse in the morning or after a period of rest
tenderness to touch the affected area
mild heat
loss of movement and strength around the ankle and foot

People can have one or multiple symptoms.

2,Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,"Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of blast cells (immature white blood cells) in your blood increases.
Most of the symptoms are caused by the lack of healthy blood cells in your blood supply.
Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia include:

pale skin
feeling tired and breathless
having repeated infections over a short space of time
unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nose bleeds
high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
night sweats
bone and joint pain
easily bruised skin
swollen lymph nodes (glands)
abdominal pain – caused by a swollen liver or spleen
unexplained weight loss 
a purple skin rash (purpura)

In some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the affected cells can spread from your bloodstream into your central nervous system. This can cause a series of neurological symptoms (related to the brain and nervous system), including:

headaches
seizures (fits)
vomiting
blurred vision
dizziness

3,Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: Children,"As the leukaemia cells multiply in the bone marrow, the production of normal blood cells is reduced. Children may therefore become tired and lethargic because of anaemia, which is caused by a lack of red blood cells.
Children may develop bruises, and bleeding may take longer to stop because of the low number of platelets present in their blood (which help blood to clot). Sometimes, children suffer from infections because of low numbers of normal white blood cells.
A child is likely to feel generally unwell and may complain of aches and pains in the limbs or may have swollen lymph glands.
At first, the symptoms are just like those of a viral infection, but when they continue for more than a week or two, the diagnosis usually becomes clear.

4,Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: Teenagers and young adults,"Many of the symptoms of ALL are caused by having fewer than normal healthy blood cells in the body. Symptoms can include:

looking paler than usual and feeling tired – because of too few red blood cells (anaemia)
bruises – you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal
infections – because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection
aches and pains in your bones
swollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your groin
feeling unwell and run down
fever and sweats – you may have a high temperature without any obvious cause, such as an infection
headaches and visual disturbance

There can be other reasons you may have these symptoms. But if you are worried that you may have ALL, you should speak to your GP. They’ll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor.

5,Acute myeloid leukaemia,"The symptoms of AML usually develop over a few weeks and become increasingly more severe. Symptoms can include:

pale skin
tiredness
breathlessness
frequent infections
unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds

In more advanced cases, AML can make you extremely vulnerable to life-threatening infections or serious internal bleeding.

8,Acute pancreatitis,"The main symptom of acute pancreatitis is a severe, dull pain around the top of your stomach that develops suddenly.
This aching pain often gets steadily worse and can travel along your back or below your left shoulder blade. Eating or drinking may also make you feel worse very quickly, especially fatty foods.
Leaning forward or curling into a ball may help to relieve the pain, but lying flat on your back often increases the pain.
Acute pancreatitis caused by gallstones usually develops after eating a large meal. If the condition is caused by alcohol, the pain often develops 6 to 12 hours after drinking a significant amount of alcohol.

9,Addison’s disease,"Addison’s disease can be difficult to detect at first, because early symptoms are similar to symptoms of many other health conditions.
Initial symptoms of Addison’s disease can include:

fatigue (lack of energy or motivation)
lethargy (abnormal drowsiness or tiredness)
muscle weakness
low mood (mild depression) or irritability
loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss
the need to urinate frequently
increased thirst
craving for salty foods

Dehydration can also be an early sign of Addison’s disease. It’s caused by lack of the hormone aldosterone in your body, which is used to regulate the balance of salt and water.

",many case people alcoholrelated liver disease arld dont noticeable symptom liver badly damaged
12,Allergic rhinitis,"Allergic rhinitis usually causes cold-like symptoms, such as:

sneezing
itchiness
a blocked or runny nose

These symptoms usually start soon after coming into contact with something you’re allergic to.
Some people only get allergic rhinitis seasonally because they’re allergic to things like tree or grass pollen. Other people get allergic rhinitis all year round.

They can cause:

sneezing
a runny or blocked nose
red, itchy, watery eyes
wheezing and coughing
a red, itchy rash
worsening of asthma or eczema symptoms

Most allergic reactions are mild, but occasionally a severe reaction called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock can occur. This is a medical emergency and needs urgent treatment.

14,Alzheimer’s disease,"Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive condition. This means the symptoms develop gradually and become more severe over time.
The first sign of Alzheimer’s disease is usually minor memory problems. For example, a loss of interest and enjoyment in day-to-day activities. It’s also common to forget about recent conversations, events or the names of places.
As the condition develops, memory problems become more severe.
Other symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease
Other changes caused by Alzheimer’s disease that could cause you concern include:

confusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places
difficulty planning or making decisions
problems with speech and language

15,Anal cancer,"The symptoms of anal cancer are often similar to more common and less serious conditions affecting the anus, such as piles (haemorrhoids) and anal fissures (small tears or sores).
Symptoms of anal cancer can include:

bleeding from the bottom (rectal bleeding)
itching and pain around the anus
small lumps around the anus
a discharge of mucus from the anus
loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence)

However, some people with anal cancer don’t have any symptoms.

fear of ‘being fat’ or gaining weight
problems with self-esteem and body image when it comes to food and weight
restricting food intake
keeping your body weight low, to the point it’s unhealthy

Restricting your food intake means your body isn’t getting enough energy or nutrition. This can lead to other physical symptoms.
Other signs of anorexia
Eating too little for a long time can cause physical symptoms, like:

fine downy hair (lanugo) growing on the body
more hair on the face
pubic hair becoming sparse and thin

27,Atopic eczema,"Atopic eczema causes areas of skin to become itchy, dry, cracked, sore and red.
There will usually be periods where the symptoms improve, followed by periods where they get worse (flare-ups). Flare-ups may occur as often as 2 or 3 times a month.
Atopic eczema can occur all over the body, but is most common on the hands (especially fingers), the insides of the elbows or backs of the knees, and the face and scalp in children. The face is more commonly involved in adults.
The severity of atopic eczema can vary a lot from person to person. People with mild eczema may only have small areas of dry skin that are occasionally itchy. In more severe cases, atopic eczema can cause widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body and constant itching.
Scratching can disrupt your sleep, make your skin bleed, and cause secondary infections. It can also make itching worse, and a cycle of itching and regular scratching may develop. This can lead to sleepless nights and difficulty concentrating at school or work.
Areas of skin affected by eczema may also turn temporarily darker or lighter after the condition has improved. This is more noticeable in people with darker skin. It’s not a result of scarring or a side effect of steroid creams, but more of a “footprint” of old inflammation and will eventually return to its normal colour.

28,Atrial fibrillation,"Some people with atrial fibrillation have no symptoms. Many will not even be aware that they have an irregular heartbeat. Sometimes it’s only discovered during routine tests or investigations for another condition.
The most obvious symptom of atrial fibrillation is palpitations. Palpitation is an awareness of your heartbeat. For example, your heart might feel like it’s pounding, fluttering or beating irregularly. You may feel these sensations in your chest, throat or neck.
You may feel that your heart is beating fast, even when you’re not exercising.
You may also experience:

tiredness
breathlessness
dizziness
feeling faint
chest discomfort or pain

30,Bacterial vaginosis,"Often there are no symptoms of bacterial vaginosis. Some women may notice a change in the normal discharge from the vagina.
This discharge will usually be white or grey, thin or watery and have a strong, unpleasant fishy smell. This can be more noticeable during and after sex, and during periods.
Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause itching or irritation.
",often symptom bacterial vaginosis woman may notice change normal discharge vagina discharge usually white grey thin watery strong unpleasant fishy smell noticeable sex period bacterial vaginosis usually cause itching irritation
31,Benign prostate enlargement,"The symptoms of benign prostate enlargement are caused by the enlarged prostate placing pressure on the bladder and urethra (which carries urine from the bladder to the penis).
This can affect urination in a number of ways. For example, it can:

make it difficult for you to start urinating
weaken the flow of urine or cause ‘stopping and starting’
cause you to strain to pass urine
cause you to need to urinate frequently
cause you to wake up frequently during the night to urinate
cause a sudden urge to urinate, which can result in urinary incontinence if you can’t find a toilet quickly enough
cause you to not be able to empty your bladder fully
cause blood in the urine (haematuria)

In the later stages, benign prostate enlargement can cause urine retention and other complications such as bladder stones, bladder infections and kidney damage.

eating much faster than normal
eating until you feel uncomfortably full
eating a large amount of food when you’re not hungry
eating alone or secretly due to being embarrassed about the amount of food you’re consuming
having feelings of guilt, shame or disgust afterwards

If you feel like you have to purge what you’ve eaten after a binge to avoid gaining weight, you may have symptoms of bulimia.

35,Bladder cancer,"Blood in your urine is the most common symptom of bladder cancer.
The medical name for this is haematuria and it’s usually painless. You may notice streaks of blood in your urine or the blood may turn your urine brown. The blood isn’t always noticeable and it may come and go.
Less common symptoms of bladder cancer include:

a need to urinate on a more frequent basis
sudden urges to urinate
a burning sensation when passing urine

If bladder cancer reaches an advanced stage and begins to spread, symptoms can include:

The main symptoms include:

persistent bone pain that gets worse over time and continues into the night
swelling and redness (inflammation) over a bone, which can make movement difficult if the affected bone is near a joint
a noticeable lump over a bone
a weak bone that breaks (fractures) more easily than normal

If you or your child are experiencing persistent, severe or worsening bone pain, visit your GP. While it’s highly unlikely to be the result of bone cancer, it does require further investigation.

38,Bone cancer: Teenagers and young adults,"Bone cancer symptoms vary, and not everyone will feel the same. Many symptoms are similar to everyday aches and pains, so they can be mistaken for other things, like strains, sports injuries or growing pains.
The main symptoms are:

pain or tenderness – this may start as an ache that doesn’t go away and may be made worse by exercise or feel worse at night
swelling around the affected area of bone – swelling may not show up until the tumour is quite large and it isn’t always possible to see or feel a lump if the affected bone is deep inside the body
reduced movement – if the bone tumour is near a joint (like an elbow or knee), it can make it harder to move the joint; if it’s in a leg bone, it may cause a limp; if it’s in the backbone (spine), it may press on nerves and cause tingling and numbness in the legs or arms
a broken bone – a bone may break suddenly, or after only a minor fall or accident if the bone has been weakened by cancer.

There might also be other symptoms including:

tiredness 
a high temperature 
loss of appetite 
weight loss

If you have any of these symptoms, or you are worried that you may have a bone tumour, you should get it checked by your GP. They can talk to you about your symptoms, and arrange tests if they feel they’re needed.
Remember – most people with these symptoms won’t have bone cancer.

39,Bowel cancer,"The 3 main symptoms of bowel cancer are blood in the stools (faeces), changes in bowel habit – such as more frequent, looser stools – and abdominal (tummy) pain.
However, these symptoms are very common and most people with them do not have bowel cancer. For example, blood in the stools is more often caused by haemorrhoids (piles), and a change in bowel habit or abdominal pain is usually the result of something you have eaten.
As almost 9 out of 10 people with bowel cancer are over the age of 60, these symptoms are more important as people get older. They are also more significant when they persist despite simple treatments.
Most people who are eventually diagnosed with bowel cancer have one of the following combinations of symptoms:

a persistent change in bowel habit that causes them to go to the toilet more often and pass looser stools, usually together with blood on or in their stools
a persistent change in bowel habit without blood in their stools, but with abdominal pain
blood in the stools without other haemorrhoid symptoms, such as soreness, discomfort, pain, itching or a lump hanging down outside the back passage
abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always provoked by eating, sometimes resulting in a reduction in the amount of food eaten and weight loss

The symptoms of bowel cancer can be subtle and don’t necessarily make you feel ill.

40,Bowel polyps,"Most people with polyps won’t be aware of them as they produce no symptoms and are often discovered by accident.
However, some larger polyps can cause:

a small amount of rectal bleeding (blood in your stool)
mucus to be produced when you open your bowels
diarrhoea or constipation
abdominal pain

42,Breast cancer (male),"The main symptom of breast cancer in men is a hard lump in one of your breasts. The lump is almost always painless.
The lump is usually located underneath the nipple and areola (the circle of dark-coloured skin surrounding the nipple).
However, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by a condition called gynaecomastia. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged.
Less common symptoms of male breast cancer include:

the nipple beginning to turn in on itself (nipple retraction)
the nipple becoming hard and inflamed, and looking sore (nipple ulceration)
fluid leaking from the nipple (nipple discharge)

",main symptom breast cancer men hard lump one breast lump almost always painless lump usually located underneath nipple areola circle darkcoloured skin surrounding nipple however vast majority breast lump caused condition called gynaecomastia common noncancerous condition male breast tissue becomes enlarged le common symptom male breast cancer include nipple beginning turn nipple retraction nipple becoming hard inflamed looking sore nipple ulceration fluid leaking nipple nipple discharge
43,Bronchitis,"The main symptom is a hacking cough, which may bring up yellow-green mucus (phlegm). Bronchitis may also cause:

headache
runny or blocked nose
aches and pains
tiredness
shortness of breath or wheezing

",main symptom hacking cough may bring yellowgreen mucus phlegm bronchitis may also cause sore throat headache runny blocked nose ache pain tiredness shortness breath wheezing
44,Carcinoid syndrome and carcinoid tumours,"In the early stages of having a carcinoid tumour, you may not have any symptoms. You may also not have symptoms if the tumour is just in your digestive system, as any hormones it produces will be broken down by your liver.
If symptoms do develop, they tend to be fairly general and can be easily mistaken for signs of other illnesses.
Symptoms may result from both the tumour itself and from any hormones it releases into the bloodstream.
Symptoms caused by the tumour
Symptoms will depend on where in the body the tumour develops:

a bowel carcinoid tumour may cause tummy pain, a blocked bowel (diarrhoea, constipation, feeling or being sick) and bleeding from the bottom (rectal bleeding)
a lung carcinoid tumour may cause a cough, which may make you cough up blood, and cause wheezing, breathlessness, chest pain and tiredness
a stomach carcinoid tumour may cause pain, weight loss, tiredness and weakness

Some tumours may not cause any symptoms and are discovered by chance. For example, an appendix carcinoid tumour may only be found when the appendix is being removed for another reason.
Symptoms caused by the hormones (carcinoid syndrome)
Typical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome include:

diarrhoea, tummy pain and loss of appetite
flushing of the skin, particularly the face
fast heart rate
breathlessness and wheezing

These symptoms may come on unexpectedly, as the hormones can be produced by the tumour at any time.
Some people may also develop carcinoid heart disease, where the heart valves thicken and stop working properly. There is also a risk of developing a rare but serious reaction called a carcinoid crisis, which involves severe flushing, breathlessness and a drop in blood pressure.

46,Cervical cancer,"The symptoms of cervical cancer aren’t always obvious, and it may not cause any symptoms at all until it’s reached an advanced stage.
This is why it’s very important that you attend all of your cervical screening appointments.

47,Chest and rib injury,"Rib and chest injuries can cause a range of symptoms including:

pain
bruising
swelling
clicking in the chest

You may have some or none of these.
It’s typical with this type of injury to have increased pain when:

taking a deep breath
coughing
laughing
sneezing
moving a certain way

There are strategies to help manage this.
Your risk of getting a chest infection is higher after a chest or rib injury. There’s lots you can do to minimise the chance of this happening.

48,Chickenpox,"Chickenpox causes a rash of red, itchy spots that turn into fluid-filled blisters. They then crust over to form scabs, which eventually drop off.
Chickenpox spots
The spots normally appear in clusters and tend to be:

behind the ears
on the face
over the scalp
on the chest and belly
on the arms and legs

But, the spots can be anywhere on the body, including:

inside the ears and mouth
on the palms of the hands
soles of the feet
inside the nappy area.

The rash starts as small, itchy red spots. These develop a blister on top and become very itchy after about 12 to 14 hours.
After a day or two, the fluid in the blisters gets cloudy and they begin to dry out and crust over.
After 1 to 2 weeks, the crusting skin will fall off naturally.
New spots can keep appearing in waves for 3 to 5 days after the rash begins. So, different groups of spots may be at different stages of blistering or drying out.
Before chickenpox spots appear
Before the rash appears, you or your child may have some mild flu-like symptoms, including:

feeling sick
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or over
aching, painful muscles
headache
generally feeling unwell
loss of appetite

These symptoms, especially the fever, tend to be more common and worse in adults than in children.
Contacting your doctor about chickenpox
For most children, chickenpox is a mild illness that gets better on its own.
Chickenpox tends to be more severe in adults than children. Adults have a higher risk of developing complications.

49,Chlamydia,"Most people with chlamydia don’t notice any symptoms and don’t know they have it. So it’s important to get tested if you think you’re infected.
If you do get symptoms, it’s usually 1 to 3 weeks after having unprotected sex. Some people don’t get symptoms until months later.
If you do develop symptoms, you may experience:

pain when peeing
unusual discharge from the vagina, penis or anus
pain in the lower tummy, bleeding after sex, and bleeding between periods
pain in the testicles
red, sticky eyes

Sometimes symptoms can disappear after a few days. Even if symptoms go away you may still have the infection and could pass it on.

51,Chronic myeloid leukaemia,"In its early stages, chronic myeloid leukaemia usually causes no noticeable symptoms and it is often diagnosed during tests for a different condition.
When symptoms do develop, they are similar to those of many other illnesses and can include:

tiredness
frequent infections
unexplained weight loss
a feeling of bloating
less commonly, swollen lymph nodes – glands found in the neck and under your arms, which are usually painless

Chronic myeloid leukaemia can also cause swelling in your spleen (an organ that helps to filter impurities from your blood). This can cause a lump to appear on the left side of your abdomen, which may be painful when touched. A swollen spleen can also put pressure on your stomach, causing a lack of appetite and indigestion.
The symptoms of chronic myeloid leukaemia in its advanced stage will be much more noticeable and troublesome. They include:

severe fatigue
bone pain
night sweats
fever
easily bruised skin

52,Cirrhosis,"There are usually few symptoms in the early stages of cirrhosis. However, as your liver loses its ability to function properly, you’re likely to experience a loss of appetite, nausea and itchy skin.
In the later stages, symptoms can include jaundice, vomiting blood, dark, tarry-looking stools, and a build-up of fluid in the legs (oedema) and abdomen (ascites).

63,Depression,"Symptoms of depression can be very different from person to person. However, as a general rule, if you are depressed you feel hopeless, sad and lacking interest in things that used to make you feel happy.
Depression symptoms are bad enough to interfere with work, social life and family life, and can persist for weeks or months.
Doctors describe depression in one of three ways, depending on how serious it is:

mild depression – it has some impact on daily life
moderate depression – it has a significant impact on your daily life
severe depression – this makes it nearly impossible to get through your life day to day

A few people with severe depression may have symptoms of psychotic depression.
Below is a list of depression symptoms – it’s unlikely that one person would have all of them.
Psychological depression symptoms include:

continuous sadness or low mood
losing interest in things
losing motivation
not getting any enjoyment in life
feeling tearful
feeling guilty
feeling anxious
feeling irritable
finding it hard to make decisions
feeling intolerant of other people
feeling helpless
feeling hopeless
low self-esteem
feeling worried
thinking about suicide
thinking about harming yourself

Physical symptoms include:

speaking or moving slower than usual
aches and pains that can’t be explained
losing, or sometimes gaining, appetite or weight
constipation
loss of interest in sex
disturbed sleep (having trouble falling asleep, for example, or waking up very early)
loss of energy
changes in your menstrual cycle (the time of the month when you get your period)

Social symptoms are common too. These include:

avoiding talking to or spending time with your friends
taking part in fewer social activities
neglecting interests and hobbies
doing poorly at work
difficulties with your family or home life

It’s not always possible to tell that you’re having symptoms of depression right away – it can start and progress gradually. A lot of people don’t realise they’re ill and try to carry on and cope with their symptoms. Sometimes it takes a friend or family member to notice that there’s a problem.

66,Ebola virus disease,"A person infected with Ebola virus will typically develop:

a high temperature (fever)
a headache
joint and muscle pain
a sore throat
severe muscle weakness

These symptoms start suddenly between 2 and 21 days after becoming infected.
Diarrhoea, vomiting, a rash, stomach pain and reduced kidney and liver function can follow. The person may then bleed internally, and may also bleed from the ears, eyes, nose or mouth.

67,Epilepsy,"The main symptoms of epilepsy are repeated seizures. There are different types of seizure, depending on which part of the brain it affects.
The cells in the brain, known as neurons, conduct electrical signals. They communicate with each other in the brain using chemical messengers. During a seizure, there are abnormal bursts of neurons firing off electrical impulses. This can cause the brain and body to behave strangely.
The severity of seizures can differ from person to person. Some people experience an odd feeling with no loss of awareness, or may have a “trance-like” state for a few seconds or minutes. Others lose consciousness and have convulsions (uncontrollable shaking of the body).
Some people might only have a single seizure. If they do not have a high risk of having further seizures, they would not be regarded as having epilepsy.
Types of seizures
People with epilepsy can experience any type of seizure, although most people have a consistent pattern of symptoms.
Seizures can occur when you’re awake or asleep.
The type of seizure depends on how much of the brain it affects. There are:

focal (or partial) seizures – where only a small part of the brain is affected
generalised seizures – where most or all of the brain is affected

Some seizures do not fit into these categories and are known as unclassified seizures.
Focal seizures
There are two main types of focal seizure.




Focal aware seizures

Focal aware seizures are where you remain fully conscious throughout.
Symptoms of a focal aware seizure can include:

a general strange feeling that is hard to describe
a “rising” feeling in your tummy – sometimes likened to the sensation in your stomach when on a fairground ride
an intense feeling that events have happened before (déjà vu)
experiencing an unusual smell or taste
a tingling sensation, or “pins and needles”, in your arms and legs
a sudden intense feeling of fear or joy
stiffness or twitching in part of the body, such as an arm or hand

These seizures are sometimes known as “warnings” or “auras”, because they can be a sign that another type of seizure is on its way. This can give you time to warn people around you and make sure you’re in a safe place.









Focal impaired awareness seizures

Focal impaired awareness seizures are when you lose your sense of awareness. You won’t remember what happened after this type of seizure.
The symptoms of a focal impaired awareness seizure can involve random bodily behaviour, like:

smacking your lips
rubbing your hands
making random noises
moving your arms around
picking at clothes
fiddling with objects
adopting an unusual posture
chewing or swallowing

During a focal impaired awareness seizure, you’ll not be able to respond to anyone else. You’ll usually have no memory of it.





Generalised seizures
There are 6 main types of generalised seizure.




Absences

Absence seizures mainly affect children, but they also occur in adults. They cause the person to lose awareness of their surroundings, usually for up to 15 seconds. The person will seem to stare vacantly into space. Some people will flutter their eyes or smack their lips. The person will have no memory of the seizure.
Absences can occur several times a day. They may affect a child’s performance at school. They can be dangerous if they occur at a critical time, like crossing a busy road.









Myoclonic seizures

These types of seizures cause your arms, legs or upper body to jerk or twitch, as if you have received an electric shock. They often only last for a fraction of a second, and you’ll normally remain conscious during this time.
Myoclonic jerks often happen in the first few hours after waking up. They can occur in combination with other types of generalised seizures.









Clonic seizures

These cause the same sort of twitching as myoclonic jerks, except the symptoms will last longer, normally up to 2 minutes. You might lose consciousness during a clonic seizure.









Atonic seizures

Atonic seizures cause all your muscles to relax suddenly. There’s a chance you may fall to the ground and you could injure yourself.









Tonic seizures

Tonic seizures cause all your muscles to suddenly become stiff. You might lose balance and fall over. Like atonic seizures, there’s a risk of injury.









Tonic-clonic seizures

Tonic-clonic seizures or convulsions have 2 stages. Your body will initially become stiff and then your arms and legs will begin twitching. You’ll lose consciousness and some people will wet themselves. The seizure normally lasts a minute, but can last longer.
This type of seizure is what most people think of as an epileptic fit.





Myoclonic-tonic-clonic seizures and Myoclonic-atonic are seizures involving a combination of the generalised seizures above.

68,Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157,"Symptoms include diarrhoea, stomach cramps and occasionally fever. About half of people with the infection will have bloody diarrhoea.
People usually notice symptoms 3 to 4 days after they have been infected. But symptoms can start any time between 1 and 14 days afterwards.
These symptoms can last up to 2 weeks.
Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS)
A small number of people with E. coli O157 infection go on to develop a serious condition called haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). Symptoms of HUS include:

peeing less
tiredness
swelling
bruising

This can sometimes lead to kidney failure and death, although this is rare. The risk of HUS is highest in children aged under 5 years.
Some people become infected but don’t develop symptoms.

69,Ewing sarcoma: Children,"Pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer. It is frequently worse at night. However, symptoms may vary depending on the position and size of the cancer. There may be some swelling in the affected area if the tumour is close to the surface of the body and it may become tender to touch. This may cause a limp if in the leg or pelvis. Bone cancer is sometimes discovered when a bone that has been weakened by cancer breaks after the child has a minor fall or accident. Occasionally, there may be fever or weight loss.

70,Febrile seizures,"The main symptom of a febrile seizure is a fit that occurs while a child has a fever.
Febrile seizures often occur during the first day of a fever, which is defined as a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above. 
However, there appears to be no connection between the extent of your child’s fever and the start of a seizure. Seizures can occur even if your child has a mild fever.
Simple febrile seizures can happen when there’s a rapid rise in temperature and you may only realise your child is ill when they have a fit. Alternatively, they can occur as your child’s temperature drops from a high level.
During simple febrile seizures:

your child’s body will become stiff and their arms and legs will begin to twitch
they’ll lose consciousness and they may wet or soil themselves
they may also vomit and foam at the mouth and their eyes may roll back
the seizure usually lasts for less than five minutes
following the seizure, your child may be sleepy for up to an hour afterwards

Complex febrile seizures tend to last longer than 15 minutes, and the symptoms may only affect one area of your child’s body. The seizure sometimes recurs within 24 hours or during the period in which your child is ill.

73,Food allergy,"The symptoms of a food allergy almost always develop a few seconds or minutes after eating the food.
Some people may develop a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which can be life threatening.
The most common type of allergic reaction to food is known as an IgE-mediated food allergy.
Symptoms include:

tingling or itching in the mouth
a raised, itchy red rash (urticarial) – in some cases, the skin can turn red and itchy, but without a raised rash
swelling of the face, mouth (angioedema), throat or other areas of the body
difficulty swallowing
wheezing or shortness of breath

74,Functional neurological disorder (FND),"FND can have many symptoms that can vary from person to person. Some people may have few symptoms, and some people may have many.


A diagnosis of FND should be made because you have one or more clinical features that a specialist can recognise as typical of FND. It shouldn’t be made just because scans or tests for other neurological conditions that have similar symptoms are normal.





What is a clinical feature?

A clinical feature is a distinctive way that your symptom presents that is unique to FND. For example, it could be that your eyes close during seizures, or that limb weakness briefly disappears during certain physical tests. Clinical features are what specialists use to identify FND from other neurological conditions with similar symptoms.









Functional limb weakness

Functional limb weakness is when a leg or an arm doesn’t work properly. In FND, this happens because of a problem with how the nervous system is functioning.
It can cause a range of symptoms, including:

problems walking
heaviness down one side
dropping things
feeling like a limb isn’t part of you

Functional limb weakness can often look a symptoms of a stroke or multiple sclerosis. If you have FND, any scans you have will show no damage to the brain to explain the weakness.
A specialist will diagnose functional limb weakness based on specific clinical features (symptoms) they find when they examine you.
Read more about functional limb weakness









Functional seizures

A functional seizure (also called a dissociative seizure) is an episode where someone loses either their awareness of, or their ability to interact with, their surroundings. It may look like an epileptic seizure or a faint.
A functional seizure can appear as:

uncontrolled shaking
suddenly going motionless and unresponsive
staring without responding to surroundings

Some people are aware that seizures are about to happen, while others experience them without warning.
A specialist will ask you and your friends or family about what happens during a seizure, and will look at any video footage you can provide. They’ll use this evidence to decide if it’s epilepsy, a faint or a functional seizure.
Read more about functional seizures









Functional tremor

Tremor is uncontrollable shaking of part of the body. It’s most often found in the arms and legs.
Functional tremor can come and go throughout the day, and change in speed and strength.
A specialist will diagnose functional tremor based on specific features of your symptoms that they find when they examine you.
Read more about functional tremor









Functional dystonia

Functional dystonia is a type of muscle spasm. It causes a part of the body to become stuck in an unusual position. This can be for a short or a long period of time.
Someone with functional dystonia will often present with curled fingers, a clenched hand, or an ankle that turns in.
Read more about functional dystonia









Functional gait disorder

Functional gait disorder describes the problems walking that you may experience as part of FND.
You may find you have a dragging leg, that you feel unsteady when walking, or that you make excessive movements when walking.
A specialist will diagnose functional gait disorder based on clinical features, like the way your walking changes when doing different activities.
Read more about functional gait disorder









Functional facial spasm

Functional facial spasm is when there are muscle spasms in the face. These can lead to problems like a narrowing of the eye or the pulling of the mouth or jaw upwards, downwards or to the side.
Read more about functional facial spasm









Functional tics

A tic is a fast repetitive movement or sound that happens suddenly. Functional tics can be a symptom of FND.
Functional tics can look similar to the tics in Tourette’s syndrome. A specialist will look at the clinical features of your tics to make a diagnosis. It’s quite common to have both functional tics and Tourette’s syndrome.









Functional jerks and twitches

A symptom of FND can be jerks or twitches, which is when someone makes sudden movements.
Everyone experiences random jerks occasionally, like when you jolt awake as you’re falling asleep. In FND, however, these uncontrolled jerks and twitches can become much more frequent.
Read more about functional jerks and twitches









Functional drop attacks

Functional drop attacks are when someone falls to the ground suddenly, without losing consciousness.
Read more about functional drop attacks









Functional sensory symptoms

A symptom of FND can be numbness, pins and needles, or a feeling that a limb isn’t part of your body.
Read more about functional sensory symptoms









Functional cognitive symptoms

Problems with your memory or concentration can be a symptom of FND.
You might find that you:

lose track while doing things, for example being unable to remember why you went into a room
go blank, for example when trying to recall your pin number
lose track during conversations
misplace important things, like your keys or phone
forget words

It’s normal to experience these things occasionally. For someone with functional cognitive symptoms, these things happen so often that they interfere with work and home life.
The cognitive symptoms of FND can sometimes be mistaken for dementia. Specialists will look for features that are typical of functional cognitive symptoms when diagnosing FND.
Read more about functional cognitive symptoms









Functional speech and swallowing difficulties

Functional speech and swallowing difficulties can be a symptom of FND. You might experience:

slurred speech
a new stutter
difficulties finding the right word
unintentionally mixing words up
whispering or hoarse speech (dysphonia)
difficulty swallowing, including feeling like there’s something stuck in your throat

A specialist will diagnose functional speech and swallowing difficulties based on specific features.
Read more about functional speech and swallowing difficulties









Persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD)

PPPD (sometimes called functional dizziness, triple PD or 3PD) can be a symptom of FND.
The dizziness in PPPD is typically experienced constantly, and gets worse while walking or in crowded environments.
There are many causes of dizziness. Most people with PPPD have another cause of dizziness at the same time. A specialist will diagnose PPPD based on specific features when they assess you.
Read more about PPPD









Functional visual symptoms

Visual symptoms can be a part of FND. You may experience changes to your vision, like:

blurred vision
double vision
photophobia (sensitivity to light)
reduced vision

A specialist will diagnose functional visual symptoms based on specific features that they find when they examine you.
Read more about functional visual symptoms









Dissociative symptoms

Dissociative symptoms are common in FND, although there are many other causes. These symptoms can be hard to describe, but are often described as feeling:

that your body is disconnected from you
that your body doesn’t belong to you
disconnected from the world around you
spaced out
that you are floating
that you are having an out-of-body experience
there but not there

You may also be able to hear what’s going on around you, but not be able to respond.
These experiences are called dissociation, and can link into other FND symptoms.
Read more about dissociative symptoms





There are other symptoms or conditions that are commonly associated with FND. These include:

chronic pain, including fibromyalgia, back and neck pain, and complex regional pain syndrome
persistent fatigue
sleep problems including insomnia (not sleeping enough) and hypersomnia (sleeping too much)
migraines and other types of headache and facial pain
irritable bowel syndrome and other problems with the function of your stomach and bowel
anxiety and panic attacks
depression
post-traumatic stress disorder
chronic urinary retention despite all tests being normal (which may be diagnosed as Fowlers syndrome)
dysfunctional breathing

75,Gallbladder cancer,"In the early stages, gallbladder cancer doesn’t cause symptoms, which means it could be at an advanced stage by the time it’s diagnosed.
Symptoms that occur at a later stage can include:

abdominal (stomach) pain
feeling sick
jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)

These symptoms could be linked to a number of conditions and may not be related to gallbladder cancer. However, if you have these symptoms, you should speak to your GP so they can investigate what’s causing them.
Other possible symptoms of gallbladder cancer can include loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss and a swollen stomach.

78,Genital symptoms,"



Ulcers on the genitals

Single ulcers (sores) could be a sign of a recent infection of syphilis, especially if there is no pain.
Painful ulcers may be due to herpes, other infections or recent trauma. It can help to take a photo of your ulcer so you can show the sexual health clinician at your appointment.
If you think you have mpox (monkeypox) or you’ve come into contact in the last 21 days with someone who has mpox, you should phone your local service before you attend in person.



Pelvic pain

There are many causes of pain in the lower tummy. For example issues of the bowel or urinary tract and many gynaecological conditions.
Some STIs such as gonorrhoea, or chlamydia, can very occasionally spread up into the womb and cause pelvic pain and/or deep pain during sex.
If you have pain like this and think you have been at risk of an STI then you should contact your local service.
If there is any possibility that you could be pregnant, take a pregnancy test.



Discharge from the end of the penis

Whether you have discomfort peeing or not, discharge from the end of the penis could mean that you have an STI such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea. Book a consultation online or contact your local sexual health service for advice.



Pain, swelling or inflammation around the testicles

Gonorrhoea and chlamydia usually affect just the urinary tract. But sometimes infection can spread to the testicle and/or the epididymis (the small tube part next to the testicle).
This will cause painful swelling for which you should get treatment urgently.
Book a consultation online or phone for advice​​.



Multiple painful genital ulcers

Having multiple genital ulcers could indicate genital herpes which is the same virus that causes cold sores.
Herpes is an extremely common virus. It sometimes causes symptoms which are mostly self-limiting. This means your immune system will deal with this itself, but it can take a few days for symptoms to settle.
Sometimes the ulcers are itchy before they become sore. There may be pain when peeing because this stings the ulcers.
Milder cases can be diagnosed and treated by your GP. If you’re worried about your symptoms, you could also contact your local sexual health service for advice.

81,Gout,"Any joint can be affected by gout, but it usually affects joints towards the ends of the limbs, like

toes, especially the big toe
ankles
knees
fingers

Signs and symptoms of gout include:

severe pain in 1 or more joints
the joint feeling hot and very tender
swelling in and around the affected joint
red, shiny skin over the affected joint

Almost everyone with gout will experience further flares at some point, usually within a year.
When gout symptoms can happen
Flares of gout tend to:

occur at night, but they can happen at any time
develop quickly over a few hours
last between 3 and 10 days
come back – you may experience flares every few months or years
become more frequent over time if not treated

After a gout flare the affected joint should start to return to normal. But, the problem can persist if treatment isn’t started early.
It’s difficult to predict how often flares will occur and when exactly they’ll happen.
Repeated gout flares can lead to joint pain and joint deformities.
When to get medical advice







                    Speak to your GP urgently if you have:
                





severe, worsening joint pain and swelling
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above

This could mean you have an infection inside the joint (septic arthritis).

Soon after the mouth ulcers appear, you may notice a rash made up of small, raised red spots on the skin.
These can develop on the:

fingers
back of the hands
palms of the hand
soles of the feet
buttocks
groin

The spots may then turn into small blisters with a grey centre.
The spots and blisters can sometimes be itchy or uncomfortable and usually last up to 10 days.

86,Hepatitis C,"Many people with hepatitis C won’t have any symptoms until the liver has been significantly damaged. This means many people have the infection without knowing.
Early symptoms (acute hepatitis C)
Most people will not have symptoms during the first 6 months of a hepatitis C infection. This stage is known as acute hepatitis C.
If symptoms do develop, they usually occur a few weeks after infection.
Early symptoms may include:

a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F) or above
tiredness
loss of appetite
abdominal pain
feeling and being sick
yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)

88,HIV,"Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after infection, which lasts for 2 weeks. This is known as primary HIV infection.
Symptoms of primary HIV infection include:

fever (high temperature)
sore throat
body rash

Other symptoms can include:

tiredness
joint pain
muscle pain
swollen glands

After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause symptoms for many years. During this time, HIV continues to be active and causes damage to your immune system.
This means many people who have HIV do not know they’re infected.
Once the immune system becomes severely damaged symptoms can include:

weight loss
chronic diarrhoea
night sweats
skin problems
recurrent infections
serious life-threatening illnesses

89,Hodgkin lymphoma: Children,"The first sign of Hodgkin lymphoma is usually a painless swelling of 1 gland, or a group of lymph glands, which continues for some weeks or even months. The first glands that are likely to be affected are in the neck or above the collarbone, most often only on 1 side. However, it’s important to remember that children’s glands can also become swollen when they have a common infection that causes a sore throat or a cold. If glands in the chest are affected, this can cause a cough or breathlessness. This is caused by the pressure the glands exert on the airways.
Sometimes, a child with Hodgkin lymphoma may have a high temperature (fever), night sweats, weight loss or itchy skin.

90,Huntington’s disease,"People can start to show the symptoms of Huntington’s disease at almost any age. Most will develop problems between the ages of 30 and 50.
The condition gradually gets worse for around 10-25 years, until the person dies.
Early symptoms
Behavioural changes are often the first symptoms of Huntington’s disease. These changes often include:

a lack of emotions and not recognising the needs of others
periods of aggression, excitement, depression, antisocial behaviour and anger
apathy – causing a person to appear lazy or have a lack of interest in hygiene and self care
difficulty concentrating on more than one task and handling complex situations
irritability and impulsiveness








                    Speak to your GP if:
                





you’re worried you might have early symptoms of Huntington’s disease, especially if there’s a history of the condition in your family
 

Later symptoms
Further symptoms of Huntington’s might include:

psychiatric problems – some people develop obsessive behaviours, delusional thoughts or behaviours, stubborness, lack of self awareness, or suicidal thoughts
uncontrollable movements of the face, jerking, clicking or fidgety movements of the limbs and body
difficulty eating because the mouth and throat muscles don’t work properly which can lead to choking and chest infections
communication problems – difficulty putting thoughts into words and slurring of speech
sexual problems – a loss of interest in sex or making inappropriate sexual demands
balance problems

In the later stages of Huntington’s disease, the person will need full nursing care.
Death is usually from a secondary cause, like pneumonia or another infection.
You might find the palliative care section useful if you’re caring for someone who’s dying, or if you want to plan your end of life care.

91,Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar),"Symptoms of hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes tend to develop slowly over a few days or weeks. In some cases, there may be no symptoms until the blood sugar level is very high.
Symptoms of hyperglycaemia include:

increased thirst and a dry mouth
needing to pee frequently
tiredness
blurred vision
unintentional weight loss
recurrent infections, such as thrush, bladder infections (cystitis) and skin infections

92,Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar),"Most people will have some warning that their blood glucose levels are too low, which gives them time to correct them. Symptoms usually occur when blood sugar levels fall below four millimoles (mmol) per litre.
Typical early warning signs are feeling hungry, trembling or shakiness, and sweating. In more severe cases, you may also feel confused and have difficulty concentrating. In very severe cases, a person experiencing hypoglycaemia can lose consciousness.
It’s also possible for hypoglycaemia to occur during sleep, which can cause excess sweating, disturbed sleep, and feeling tired and confused upon waking.

94,Indigestion,"The main symptom of indigestion is pain or a feeling of discomfort in your upper abdomen (dyspepsia). People often experience the associated feeling of burning behind the breastbone (heartburn), but this may occur on its own.
These symptoms usually come on soon after eating or drinking, although there can sometimes be a delay between eating a meal and experiencing indigestion.
Heartburn is caused by acid that passes from your stomach into your gullet (oesophagus).
If you have indigestion, you may also have symptoms such as:

feeling uncomfortably full or heavy
belching or flatulence(passing wind)
bringing food or fluid back up from your stomach (reflux)
bloating
feeling sick (nausea)
vomiting

dizzy spells
blackouts, faints or fits (seizures)
palpitations
breathlessness
chest pain

It’s important to speak to your GP or a healthcare professional if you have had any of these symptoms.
An inherited heart condition can also cause cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. As some affected people don’t have symptoms, this means that sometimes the first time a family is aware that they’re affected by an inherited heart condition is after a sudden cardiac death.

100,Leg cramps,"A leg cramp is an episode of sudden pain in the muscles of the leg. It’s caused by an involuntary contracting (shortening) of the leg muscle.
Cramps usually occur in the calf muscles, although they can affect any part of your leg. This includes your feet and thighs. Cramps can last from a few seconds up to 10 minutes. Thigh muscle cramps tend to last the longest.
During a cramping episode, the affected muscles will become tight and painful and the feet and toes will be stiff.

101,Lipoedema,"People with lipoedema usually have a small waist, but large hips and thighs. Their upper body and lower body can be completely different sizes. This makes it difficult to shop for clothes that fit right.
Symptoms can include:

enlargement of your legs, and in some cases arms, but usually not your feet or hands
pain, discomfort, heaviness or tenderness affected areas
affected areas of your body can bruise easily, sometimes for no obvious reason

Speak to your doctor if you are experiencing any of these symptoms. They’ll be able to give you help and advice on how to manage your symptoms.
Other conditions
Other health conditions, like lymphoedema, can cause large or swollen legs. Sometimes people with lipoedema can also develop this condition.

102,Lumbar stenosis," Symptoms like aching, cramping, tingling, heaviness and occasional weakness in the legs are usually brought on by walking or standing. They can be eased by sitting or leaning forward.
Patients with lumbar stenosis can also have back pain. However, low back pain with no leg symptoms is usually not thought to be caused by stenosis.  
Lumbar stenosis is a long term condition, and symptoms are often variable from day to day.  Many patients have found that managing their symptoms can help improve their quality of life.

103,Lupus,"SLE can cause a wide range of symptoms, depending on the areas of the body that are affected. The most common symptoms are:

fatigue (extreme tiredness)
rashes – particularly on the face, wrists and hands
joint pain and swelling

As the symptoms of SLE can be similar to a number of other conditions, many of which are more common, it can be difficult to diagnose.
If you have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by SLE, you should see your GP so they can try to determine the cause.

104,Lymphoedema,"The main symptom of lymphoedema is swelling in all or part of a limb or another part of the body, which can cause problems fitting into clothes, or jewellery and watches starting to feel tight.
At first, the swelling may come and go. It may get worse during the day and then go down overnight. Without treatment, it will usually become more severe and persistent.
Other symptoms in an affected body part can include:

an aching, heavy feeling
difficulty with movement
repeated skin infections
the skin becoming hard and tight
folds developing in the skin
wart-like growths developing on the skin
a leakage of fluid through the skin

When these symptoms start depends on what is causing the condition.
If lymphoedema is caused by abnormal development of the lymphatic system (a network of channels and glands distributed throughout the body that remove unwanted bacteria and particles from the body), the symptoms can develop at any age, but most commonly start during infancy, adolescence or early adulthood.
In these cases, the swelling may start on one side of the body to begin with, although the other side will usually become swollen as well over time – particularly the lower leg.
If lymphoedema is caused by damage to the lymphatic system, the symptoms can develop at any time. For example, if your lymphatic system is damaged due to treatment for breast cancer, lymphoedema may not develop for several months or even years.

The initial symptoms of malaria include:

a high temperature (fever)
headache
sweats
chills
muscle aches or pains
vomiting and or diarrhoea

106,Malnutrition,"Malnutrition can be difficult to recognise. It can happen very gradually, which can make it very difficult to spot in the early stages.
Common signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:

loss of appetite and lack of interest in food or fluids
unplanned weight loss – this might cause clothing, rings, watches or dentures to become loose
tiredness or low energy levels
reduced ability to perform everyday tasks like showering, getting dressed or cooking

110,Migraine,"The main symptom of migraine is usually an intense headache on one side of the head. In some cases, the pain can occur on both sides of your head and may affect your face or neck.
The pain might get worse when you move and may stop you from carrying out normal activities.

increased sensitivity to light and sound – which is why many people with a migraine headache want to rest in a quiet, dark room
sweating
poor concentration
feeling very hot or very cold
abdominal (tummy) pain

Aura symptoms typically develop over the course of about 5 minutes and last for up to an hour. The aura might start before the headache or you might experience it at the same time as a headache. Some people may experience aura followed by only a mild headache or no headache at all.
Causes of migraine
The exact cause of migraine is unknown. It’s thought to be the result of abnormal brain activity temporarily affecting nerve signals, chemicals and blood vessels in the brain.
Around half of all people who have migraine have a close relative with the condition. This suggests that genes may play a role.
Migraine triggers
It may help to keep a diary to see if you can identify a consistent trigger. It can be difficult to tell if something is a trigger or if what you’re experiencing is an early symptom of a migraine attack.
There might not always be a trigger for your headache.
Possible migraine triggers include:

hormonal changes
starting your period
emotional triggers like anxiety, depression and stress
physical triggers like tiredness, poor posture, neck or shoulder tension and jet lag
fasting or low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)
strenuous exercise, if you’re not used to it
dietary triggers like alcohol, caffeine, chocolate or citrus fruit
dehydration
environmental triggers like bright lights, flickering screens, smoking or smoky rooms, loud noises, strong smells or changes in the weather

Medication can also trigger migraine attacks. For example medication like some types of sleeping tablets, the combined contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Speak to your GP if you start to experience migraine attacks after starting to take a new medication.
Some people crave chocolate before a migraine begins. This can be a sign that you’re about to have a migraine attack rather than the chocolate being the trigger for the migraine.

111,Mouth cancer,"Mouth cancer can develop on most parts of the mouth, including the lips, gums and occasionally, the throat.
The most common symptoms of mouth cancer include:

red or white patches in the mouth or throat
a lump
ulcers

Other symptoms may include:

persistent pain in the mouth
pain or difficulty when swallowing (dysphagia)
changes in your voice, or speech problems
swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your neck
unexplained weight loss
bleeding or numbness in the mouth
a tooth, or teeth, that becomes loose for no obvious reason
difficulty moving your jaw

112,Multiple myeloma,"In the early stages, myeloma may not cause any symptoms. It’s often only suspected or diagnosed after a routine blood or urine test.
However, myeloma will eventually cause a wide range of problems, including:

a persistent dull ache or specific areas of tenderness in your bones
weak bones that break (fracture) easily
tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath (caused by anaemia)
repeated infections
less commonly, bruising and unusual bleeding – such as frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums and heavy periods

113,Multiple system atrophy (MSA),"Everyone with MSA will experience different symptoms. Symptoms often start between the ages of 50 and 60, but they can begin anytime from the age of 30.
You’re likely to experience muscle control or balance problems, like those of Parkinson’s disease or Ataxia. It’s a progressive disease which means symptoms will worsen over a period of time.
MSA can cause symptoms including:

bladder problems like a constant need to pee, loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence) or being unable to pee
low blood pressure when standing up which might cause dizziness or fainting (postural hypotension)
erection problems like erectile dysfunction
problems with co-ordination, balance and speech (cerebellar ataxia)
tremor, slowness and muscle stiffness
constipation

Someone with MSA might also have:

uncontrollable laughing or crying
problems with sleep like insomnia, restless legs or nightmares
noisy breathing
unintentional sighing
weak, quiet voice
shoulder and neck pain
problems controlling sweating
swallowing problems including difficult chewing and choking episodes
blurred vision
cold hands and feet

114,Myasthenia gravis,"The first symptoms of myasthenia gravis are often droopy eyelids or double vision. It usually affects the eyes first and may spread to other parts of the body. It can take weeks, months or years for symptoms to develop in other parts of the body.
The severity of the symptoms is different for each person. It’s likely that your symptoms will tend to get worse when you’re tired. The symptoms might improve after resting.
Symptoms can include:




Eyes

You might experience droopy eyelids affecting one or both eyes, and double vision.
In some people, only the eye muscles are affected (ocular myasthenia).
In most people, the symptoms will spread to affect other parts of the body over time.









Swallowing, speaking and breathing 

You might experience:

slurred speech
difficulty swallowing
difficulty making facial expressions like smiling
problems with chewing
a change in your voice
choking or accidentally inhaling food which can cause chest infections
shortness of breath










Limbs and neck

The muscle weakness might spread to other parts of the body like your arms, legs and neck.
You might experience:

weakness in your arms, legs, neck or other parts of your body
difficulty holding your head up
aching muscles
problems with tasks like climbing stairs or washing your hair










Myasthenic crisis

Some people can experience severe breathing and swallowing difficulties, which require immediate hospital treatment. This is called a myasthenic crisis.
It’s possible for patients to experience a myasthenic crisis before they know they have myasthenia gravis.












                    Phone 999 for an ambulance if:

115,Nasopharyngeal cancer,"It’s often difficult to recognise nasopharyngeal cancer because the symptoms are similar to other, less serious conditions. Also, many people with nasopharyngeal cancer don’t have any symptoms until the cancer reaches an advanced stage.
Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer can include:

a lump in the neck
hearing loss – usually only in 1 ear
tinnitus – hearing sounds that come from inside the body rather than from an outside source
a blocked or stuffy nose
nosebleeds

Speak to your GP if you develop any worrying symptoms, particularly if they don’t improve after a few weeks. While they’re very unlikely to be caused by nasopharyngeal cancer, it’s best to get them checked out.

116,Neuroblastoma: Children,"The symptoms vary, depending on where your child’s neuroblastoma tumour is:

if the tumour is in the abdomen, your child’s tummy may be swollen and they may complain of constipation or have difficulty passing urine (peeing)
if the tumour affects the chest area, your child may be breathless and have difficulty swallowing
if the tumour occurs in the neck, it’s often visible as a lump and occasionally affects breathing and swallowing
occasionally, there are deposits of neuroblastoma in the skin that appear as small, blue-coloured lumps
if the tumour is pressing on the spinal cord, children may have weakness in the legs and walk unsteadily – if your child is not yet walking, you may notice reduced leg movements; they may also have constipation or difficulty passing urine (peeing)
your child may be found to have high blood pressure
very rarely, children may have jerky eye and muscle movements, and general unsteadiness associated with the neuroblastoma

There are often symptoms of tiredness, being pale, loss of appetite, weight loss, bone pain and generalised discomfort.

117,Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),"There aren’t usually any symptoms of NAFLD in the early stages. You probably won’t know you have it unless it’s diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason.
Occasionally, people with NASH or fibrosis (more advanced stages of the disease) may experience:

a dull or aching pain in the top right of the tummy (over the lower right side of the ribs)
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
unexplained weight loss
weakness

If cirrhosis (the most advanced stage) develops, you can get more severe symptoms such as yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice), itchy skin, and swelling in the legs, ankles, feet or tummy.
Read more about the symptoms of cirrhosis.

118,Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: Children,"The first sign of NHL is usually a lump somewhere in the body, which is caused by swollen lymph nodes. This can cause different symptoms, depending on where the swollen lymph nodes are. If glands in the abdomen are affected, this may cause a feeling of being full after meals and some stomach pain. Other symptoms of NHL include a high temperature (fever), tiredness, weight loss, and loss of appetite. In a few children, lymphoma cells may be found in the bone marrow or in the fluid around the spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid).

119,Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD),"OCD affects people differently. It usually causes a particular pattern of thought and behaviour.
This pattern has 4 main steps:

Obsession – where an intrusive, distressing thought, image or urge repeatedly enters your mind.
Anxiety – the obsession provokes a feeling of intense anxiety or distress.
Compulsion – repetitive behaviours or mental acts that you feel you have to do as a result of the anxiety and distress caused by the obsession.
Temporary relief – the compulsive behaviour brings temporary relief, but the obsession and anxiety return, causing the cycle to begin again.

Obsessive thoughts
Almost everyone has unpleasant or unwanted thoughts at some point in their life. This might be a concern that you’ve forgotten to lock the door of the house or that you might get a disease from touching other people. It could be sudden unwelcome violent or offensive mental images.
Most people are able to put these types of thoughts and concerns into context. They can then carry on with their day-to-day life. They do not repeatedly think about worries they know have little substance.
If you have persistent and unwanted thoughts that dominates your thinking, you may have developed an obsession.
Some common obsessions that affect people with OCD include:

fear of deliberately harming yourself or others – for example, fear you may attack someone else, even though this type of behaviour disgusts you
fear of harming yourself or others by mistake or accident – for example, fear you may set the house on fire by accidentally leaving the cooker on
fear of contamination by disease, infection or an unpleasant substance
a need for symmetry or orderliness – for example, you may feel the need to ensure all the tins in your cupboard face the same way

Compulsive behaviour
Compulsions happen as a way of trying to reduce or prevent the harm of the obsessive thought. However, this behaviour is either excessive or not connected at all.
For example, a person who fears becoming contaminated with dirt and germs may wash their hands repeatedly. Or someone with a fear of causing harm to their family may have the urge to repeat an action multiple times to try to ‘neutralise’ the thought of harm. This type of compulsive behaviour is particularly common in children with OCD.
Most people with OCD realise that such compulsive behaviour is irrational. They might know it makes no logical sense, but they cannot stop acting on their compulsion.
Not all compulsive behaviours will be obvious to other people.

120,Oesophageal cancer,"Oesophageal cancer doesn’t usually cause any symptoms in the early stages when the tumour is small. It’s only when it gets bigger that symptoms tend to develop.
Symptoms of oesophageal cancer can include:

difficulty swallowing
persistent indigestion or heartburn
bringing up food soon after eating
loss of appetite and weight loss
pain or discomfort in your upper tummy, chest or back

121,Osteoarthritis,"The main symptoms of osteoarthritis are pain and stiffness in your joints. This can make it difficult to move the affected joints and do certain activities.
The symptoms may come and go, which can be related to things like your activity levels and even the weather. In more severe cases, the symptoms can be continuous.
Other symptoms you or your healthcare professional may notice include:

joint tenderness
increased pain and stiffness when you have not moved your joints for a while
joints appearing slightly larger or more ‘knobbly’ than usual
a grating or crackling sound or sensation in your joints
limited range of movement in your joints
weakness and loss of muscle bulk

Osteoarthritis can affect any joint in the body. The most common areas affected are the knees, hips, and small joints in the hands. Often, you will only experience symptoms in one joint or a few joints at any one time.

124,Ovarian cyst,"Most cysts are found by chance during a scan. They’re unlikely to cause any symptoms unless they’re large or abnormal.
An ovarian cyst will usually only cause symptoms if it splits (ruptures), is very large, or it blocks the blood supply to the ovaries.

It can be helpful to keep a note of your period dates and symptoms using a calendar, a diary or an app. You can then discuss this with your doctor who can decide if any tests or treatments might be needed.
If you’re seeing your doctor, there are some useful pieces of information to think about beforehand:

the first day of your last period (when it started)
how many days your period usually lasts
what was the shortest time between your periods (from the first day of one period to the first day of the next)
what was the longest time between your periods (from the first day of one period to the first day of the next)
how often you need to change your period products on a heavy day

126,Pancreatic cancer,"In the early stages, a tumour in the pancreas doesn’t usually cause any symptoms, which can make it difficult to diagnose.
It’s important to remember that these symptoms can be caused by many different conditions, and aren’t usually the result of cancer. But you should contact your GP if you’re concerned, or if these symptoms start suddenly.
The first noticeable symptoms of pancreatic cancer are often:

pain in the back or stomach area – which may come and go at first and is often worse when you lie down or after you’ve eaten
unexpected weight loss
jaundice – the most obvious sign is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes; it also causes your urine to be dark yellow or orange and your stools (faeces) to be pale-coloured

Other possible symptoms of pancreatic cancer include:

nausea and vomiting
bowel changes
fever and shivering
indigestion
blood clots

You may also develop symptoms of diabetes if you have pancreatic cancer, because it can produce chemicals that interfere with the normal effect of insulin.
Endocrine pancreatic cancer
There are also a number of different endocrine tumours that cause different symptoms, depending on the hormone the tumour produces.

127,Parkinson’s disease,"The symptoms of Parkinson’s disease usually develop gradually and are mild at first.
There are many different symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease. Some of the more common symptoms are described below.
However, the order in which these develop and their severity is different for each individual. It’s unlikely that a person with Parkinson’s disease would experience all or most of these.

129,Personality disorder,"For example, borderline personality disorder (one of the most common types) can lead to:

disordered thinking
impulsive behaviour
problems controlling your emotions
concerns that other people will abandon you
intense but unstable relationships

Antisocial personality disorder can cause:

you to get frustrated easily
difficulty controlling anger

Other symptoms can include:

avoiding other people
being overwhelmed with feelings like anxiety or distress

130,Polio,"About 95% of people with polio won’t have any symptoms and will fight off the infection without even realising they were infected.
A small number of people will experience a flu-like illness 3 to 21 days after they’re infected.
Symptoms can include:

a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
a sore throat
a headache
abdominal (tummy) pain
aching muscles
feeling and being sick

These symptoms will usually pass within about a week.
In less than 1% of cases, the polio virus attacks the nerves in the spine and base of the brain. This can cause paralysis, usually in the legs, that develops over hours or days.
The paralysis isn’t usually permanent, and movement will often slowly return over the next few weeks and months.
But some people are left with persistent problems. If the breathing muscles are affected, it can be life threatening.

131,Polymyalgia rheumatica,"Polymyalgia rheumatica often causes pain and stiffness. This can affect the shoulders, neck and hips. These symptoms can develop quickly over a few days or weeks. Both sides of the body are usually affected.
The stiffness often feels worse first thing in the morning after you wake up. It usually starts to improve after about 45 minutes as you become more active.
Polymyalgia rheumatica may also cause:

high temperature (fever) and sweating
extreme tiredness (fatigue)
loss of appetite
weight loss
depression








                    Speak to your GP practice urgently or phone 111 if:

132,Post-polio syndrome,"The symptoms of post-polio syndrome include:

muscle weakness
shrinking of the muscles (atrophy)
tight joints (contractures)
pain in muscles or joints
chronic fatigue including physical tiredness and brain fatigue
swallowing and speech problems
respiratory problems like breathlessness and sleep apnoea
cramps and muscle twitching
being sensitive to cold temperatures

The muscle weakness and atrophy usually affects muscles that were previously affected by polio. Sometimes it affects other muscles.
This can impact your mobility and your ability to do everyday tasks like brushing your teeth or drying your hair.
Chronic fatigue is one of the most common and troublesome symptoms of post-polio syndrome. This can be physical fatigue (tiredness) and brain fatigue. Brain fatigue can cause problems with concentration, attention and memory. MRI scans can show white spots in the brains of polio survivors which may be related to brain fatigue.
The symptoms can gradually get worse over many years. There are supportive treatments that can help with symptoms.
Although post-polio syndrome is rarely life threatening, some people can develop breathing and swallowing difficulties that can lead to serious problems like chest infections.
Some people experience a sensitivity to some types of anaesthesia causing them to take longer to recover from having anaesthesia.

dizziness or light-headedness
fainting or almost fainting
a noticeably strong, fast heartbeat (palpitations)
chest pain
shortness of breath
shaking
sweating
sleep disturbance

Some symptoms of PoTS happen when you stand up and get better when you lie down. You may also experience other symptoms, like:

problems with your stomach or digestion, like feeling sick, being sick, diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal pain
headaches
extreme tiredness (fatigue)
problems with your vision, like blurred vision or tunnel vision
your hands and feet look blue – this may be more difficult to see if you have brown or black skin
weakness and feeling of heaviness in legs and arms
brain fog

Some people experience mild symptoms, while other people’s symptoms can have a big impact on their daily life.
There are some factors that can make your symptoms worse, like:

feeling too hot
not drinking enough fluids
eating, especially some forms of carbohydrates like white bread
drinking alcohol
resting too much
exercise
being on your period

134,Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP),"PSP usually develops gradually and can sometimes be mistaken for other conditions. The symptoms tend to get worse over many years.




Early symptoms

The first symptoms of PSP you might experience include:

repeated falls (often backwards) caused by a sudden loss of balance when walking
muscle stiffness, especially in the neck
fatigue
changes in personality like mood swings and irritability
changes in behaviour like recklessness and poor judgement
dislike of bright lights (photophobia)
eye problems like blurred or double vision, problems looking up and down, or involuntary eye closure
tremors (involuntary shaking of parts of the body)
slow movement










Mid term symptoms

The symptoms of PSP, like balance and mobility problems, are likely to progressively get worse.
The new symptoms that might develop at this stage include:

slurred, slow or quiet speech
problems with swallowing (dysphagia)
involuntary blinking or twitching of the eyelids
reduced blinking reflex which causes the eyes to become dry and irritated
problems sleeping
memory problems
slowness of thought
back, neck and joint pain










Long term symptoms

As the symptoms of PSP get worse, your speech might become slower and more slurred.
Mobility problems might get worse and you might need a wheelchair to help you get around.
At the advanced stage, people with PSP are likely to have difficulty controlling the muscles of their mouth, tongue and throat.
Swallowing problems can become worse because of the loss of control of the throat muscles.
PSP can cause problems like constipation and difficulty passing urine (peeing). It can also cause frequent peeing during the night. Sometimes it can cause you to lose control of your bowel and bladder movements (incontinence).

135,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis typically causes patches of skin that are dry, red and covered in silver scales. Some people find their psoriasis causes itching or soreness.
There are several different types of psoriasis. Many people have only one form of psoriasis at a time, although 2 different types can occur together. One type may change into another type, or become more severe.
Most cases of psoriasis go through cycles, causing problems for a few weeks or months before easing or stopping.
You should see your GP if you think you may have psoriasis.

137,Restless legs syndrome,"Restless legs syndrome typically causes an overwhelming urge to move your legs. It also causes an uncomfortable sensation in your legs, which can affect your arms, chest and face.
This sensation has been described as:

tingling, burning, itching or throbbing
a ‘creepy-crawly’ feeling
feeling like fizzy water is inside the blood vessels in the legs
a painful, cramping sensation in the legs, particularly in the calves

These unpleasant sensations can range from mild to unbearable. They’re usually worse in the evening and during the night. The sensation can often be relieved by moving or rubbing your legs.
Some people experience symptoms occasionally, while others have them every day. You may find it difficult to sit for long periods of time, like on a long train journey.
Periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS)
Up to 80% of people with restless legs syndrome also have periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS).
If you have PLMS, your leg will jerk or twitch uncontrollably, usually at night while you’re asleep. The movements are brief and repetitive, and usually occur every 10 to 60 seconds.
PLMS can be severe enough to wake up both you and your partner. The involuntary leg movements can also occur when you’re awake and resting.

Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis that affect the joints include:

pain
swelling
stiffness and difficulty moving affected joints

139,Rosacea,"Symptoms often begin with episodes of flushing, where the skin turns red for a short period, but other symptoms can develop as the condition progresses, such as:

burning and stinging sensations
permanent redness
spots (papules and pustules)
small blood vessels in the skin becoming visible

Rosacea is a relapsing condition, which means there are periods when symptoms are particularly bad, but less severe at others.

140,Scarlet fever,"Scarlet fever usually follows a sore throat or a skin infection, like impetigo, caused by particular strains of Streptococcus bacteria.
The symptoms of scarlet fever usually develop 2 to 5 days after infection. However, the incubation period (the period between exposure to the infection and symptoms appearing) can be as short as one day or as long as 7 days.







                    Speak to your GP if:
                




You or your child:

are feeling unwell and have been in contact with someone who has scarlet fever 
 

Rash
The distinctive rough pink-red rash caused by scarlet fever.https://dermnetnz.org/
The distinctive rough texture rash caused by scarlet fever.https://dermnetnz.org/
The distinctive pink-red rash caused by scarlet fever develops 12 to 48 hours after symptoms like a sore throat or headache.
Red blotches are the first sign of the rash. These turn into a fine pink-red rash that feels like sandpaper to touch and looks like sunburn. It may also be itchy.
On darker skin the rash may be more difficult to see although its rough texture should be apparent.
The rash usually starts on the chest and stomach, but soon spreads to other parts of the body, like the:

ears
neck
elbows
inner thighs
groin

The rash doesn’t usually spread to the face. However, the cheeks become flushed and the area just around the mouth stays quite pale. The rash will turn white if you press a glass on it.
The rash usually fades after about a week, but the outer layers of skin, usually on the hands and feet, may peel for several weeks afterwards.
In milder cases, sometimes called scarlatina, the rash may be the only symptom.
Other symptoms of scarlet fever
Other symptoms of scarlet fever may include:

swollen neck glands
loss of appetite
nausea or vomiting
red lines in the folds of the body, such as the armpit, which may last a couple of days after the rash has gone
a white coating on the tongue, which peels a few days later leaving the tongue red and swollen (this is known as strawberry tongue)
a general feeling of being unwell

144,Skin cancer (melanoma),"The first sign of a melanoma is often a new mole or a change in the appearance of an existing mole.
Normal moles are usually round or oval, with a smooth edge, and no bigger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter.
Speak to your GP as soon as possible if you notice changes in a mole, freckle or patch of skin, especially if the changes happen over a few weeks or months.
Signs to look out for include a mole that is:

getting bigger
changing shape
changing colour
bleeding or becoming crusty
itchy or painful

A helpful way to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma is the ABCDE checklist:

Asymmetrical – melanomas have 2 very different halves and are an irregular shape
Border – melanomas have a notched or ragged border
Colours – melanomas will be a mix of 2 or more colours
Diameter – melanomas are larger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter.
Enlargement or elevation – a mole that changes size over time is more likely to be a melanoma

Melanomas can appear anywhere on your body, but they most commonly appear on the back, legs, arms and face. They may sometimes develop underneath a nail.
In rare cases, melanoma can develop in the eye. Noticing a dark spot or changes in vision can be signs, although it is more likely to be diagnosed during a routine eye examination.

skin rash
skin pain
itching
a burning or heat sensation on the skin
blistering or fragile skin
sunburn that happens very easily

These symptoms can range from mild to severe. Sometimes people may also feel generally unwell due to a light sensitivity disease. For example, you may get headaches or fatigue.
Although it’s rarer, some people may have unusual freckling or scarring of the skin.

146,Slapped cheek syndrome,"Symptoms of slapped cheek syndrome usually develop 4 to 14 days after becoming infected. Sometimes, symptoms may not appear for up to 21 days.
First symptoms
Some people with slapped cheek syndrome won’t notice any early symptoms, but most people will have the following symptoms for a few days:

a slightly high temperature (fever) of around 38°C (100.4°F)
a runny nose
a sore throat
a headache
an upset stomach
feeling generally unwell

The infection is most contagious during this initial period.
Adults may also feel joint pain and stiffness. This may continue for several weeks or even months after the other symptoms have passed.
Slapped cheek rash

Image source: Indian Pediatrics Slapped cheek syndrome (PDF, 36KB)
After a few days, a distinctive bright red rash on both cheeks (‘slapped cheeks’) normally appears. Adults may not get this.
By the time this rash develops, the condition is no longer contagious.
After another few days, a light pink rash may also appear on the chest, stomach, arms and thighs. This often has a raised, lace-like appearance and may be itchy.
The rashes will normally fade within a week or two. Occasionally, the body rash may come and go for a few weeks after the infection has passed. This can be triggered by exercise, heat, anxiety or stress.

complete paralysis of one side of the body
sudden loss or blurring of vision
difficulty understanding what others are saying
problems with balance and co-ordination

156,Trigeminal neuralgia,"The main symptom of trigeminal neuralgia is sudden attacks of severe, sharp and shooting facial pain that last from a few seconds to about two minutes.
The pain is often described as an excruciating sensation, similar to an electric shock. The attacks can be so severe that you are unable to do anything during them, and the pain can sometimes bring you to your knees.
Trigeminal neuralgia usually only affects one side of your face. In rare cases it can affect both sides, although not at the same time. The pain can be in the teeth, the lower jaw, upper jaw, cheek and, less commonly, in the forehead or the eye.
You may feel aware of an impending attack of pain, though these usually come unexpectedly.
After the main, severe pain has subsided, you may experience a slight ache or burning feeling. There may also be a constant throbbing, aching or burning sensation between attacks.
You may have episodes of pain lasting regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. It is possible for the pain to then disappear completely and not recur for several months or years (a period known as “remission”). However, in severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day, and there may be no periods of remission.

feeling very tired all the time
weight loss and loss of muscle bulk
persistent infections such as thrush

The symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop very quickly in young people (over a few hours or days). In adults, the symptoms often take longer to develop (a few days or weeks).

160,Varicose eczema,"Like all types of eczema, the affected skin becomes:

itchy
red and swollen
dry and flaky 
scaly or crusty

There may be periods when these symptoms improve and periods when they become more severe.
Your legs may become swollen, especially towards the end of the day or after long periods of standing. Varicose veins (swollen and enlarged veins) are often visible on the legs.
Some people also have other symptoms, such as:

brown discolouration of the skin
red, tender and tight skin that can eventually become hardened (lipodermatosclerosis)
small, white scars (atrophie blanche)
pain
eczema affecting other parts of the body

Left untreated, leg ulcers can develop. These are long-lasting wounds that form where the skin has become damaged.

a sore and red tongue
mouth ulcers
muscle weakness
disturbed vision
psychological problems, which may include depression and confusion 
problems with memory, understanding and judgement

165,Womb (uterus) cancer,"The most common symptom of womb cancer is abnormal bleeding from the vagina, although most people with abnormal bleeding don’t have cancer.
Bleeding may start as light bleeding accompanied by a watery discharge, which may get heavier over time. Most women and anyone with a womb diagnosed with womb cancer have been through the menopause, so any vaginal bleeding will be unusual.
In women and anyone with a womb who hasn’t been through the menopause, unusual vaginal bleeding may consist of:

periods that are heavier than usual
vaginal bleeding in between normal periods

Less common symptoms include pain in the lower abdomen (tummy) and pain during sex.
If womb cancer reaches a more advanced stage, it may cause additional symptoms. These include:

pain in the back, legs, or pelvis
loss of appetite
tiredness
nausea
